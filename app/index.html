        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>A taste of Brazil in the heart of Aberdeen!
                      Hey Brazil It`s the perfect party venue.Located near the busy city centre, we are ideally placed for leisurely lunch of a night out with friends and family.
                      With seating for approximately one hundred diners, we are large enough for the office party and yet not too big to give each table individual attention.
                      Let your taste-buds take you to Brazil, the land of samba, smiles, sunshine..and simply delicious food. All our dishes are carefully prepared and cooked for tenderness by top chefs.
                      Start by choosing from the huge selection of fresh salads and side dishes. Then let our expert Passadores bring freshly cooked meats to slice and serve just for you at your table. There is a choice of a dozen different succulent cuts and your Passador will keep offering until you indicate that you are satisfied.
                      When you have enough meat, why not try a delicious sweet?
                      While you are eating, enjoy from our special selection of South American wines and experience the uniquely Brazilian taste of Caipirinha. It`ll make you want to samba party!</p>
